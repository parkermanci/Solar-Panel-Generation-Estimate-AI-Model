# Solar-Panel-Generation-Estimate-AI-Model
#Using an idea developed by Neural Designer and data from Kaggle, I created an AI model that takes into account a variety of elements, including:

Distance to solar noon, in radians;
Temperature, in Celsius;
Wind direction, in degrees;
Wind speed, in meters per second;
Sky cover, on a five-step scale from 0 to 4;
Visibility, in kilometers;
Humidity, in percentage;
Average wind speed, in meters per second;
And average pressure, in mercury inches;

With this information, the model estimates how much electricity each solar cell will produce within a three hour time period.
